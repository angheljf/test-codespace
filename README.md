# EDA on Flight Delay Data

## Introduction

This project was inspired by the dataset created by Rob Mulla (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/flight-delay-dataset-20182022). In this initial stage, I will be performing exploratory data analysis on the dataset to understand the data and the relationships between the variables. The dataset contains information about flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, from 2018 to 2022. Initially, I will be focusing on the 2018 dataset, but I will be expanding to the other years as I progress through the project.

## Data

The data is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/flight-delay-dataset-20182022). The data is in CSV and Parquet format and contains 1.5 million rows and 31 columns.
